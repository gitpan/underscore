SYNOPSIS
      no underscore; # outlaws $_

      # back to normal

DESCRIPTION
    This module detects the use of global $_ and croaks. If you want it to
    carp or confess, simply

      no underscore 'carp';

    You can also use your custom subroutine like

      no underscore sub { ... }

    You can also customize the error message like

      no undersocore 'croak', 'I said not to use $_'!

EXPORT
    None
